He doesn’t speak much but his actions surely speak volumes. His calm and steady nature has inspired and held the club together. Maybe that’s why his favorite quote is “let’s meditate”."

        desc:"He could be described as one of the most zestful members of our core. His expertise has impressed many(hopefully). One day you will find him coding the other day designing a poster. He doesn't believe in mediocrity so gear up and give your best. The best way to bribe him is with a bottle of “Thums UP” and maybe play valorant with him."

She is basically an introvert but once you get to know her she is really an amazing person and maybe a tad bit annoying (just kidding). ",

She is brilliant at multitasking, solving complex issues is like a piece of cake for her. Hard work and dedication have got her where she is now and that’s what keeps her grounded to her roots."

        desc:" His grasp on technology is just great( NO PUN INTENDED). There is nothing he doesn’t have the answer to, and if he doesn’t he will surely find the answer and get back to you. Apart from coding, Life for him is all about quoting The Office and hence, “Sometimes I’ll start a sentence and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way"
